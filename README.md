# rapidroll

This is my attempt to create rapid roll using only the pygame library.

There are some issues with the game that I am still working on:
Main Issues:
1. When the ball first dies it resets the state of the game to the beginning(score, number of lives and, tiles on screen are reset), but after the first death the score and number of lives updates fine.
2.Sometimes the ball gets stuck respawning above a spike tile and it gets stuck respawning there a few times before changing respawn.
3. I'm having trouble learning who to increase the speed of the tiles and the ball relative to the game speed


After the main issues are resolved I'm planning on improving the display of the menu screen and pause screen more appealing and adding an intro segment to the game.
